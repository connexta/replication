Replication is the process of creating a copy of a subset of data and storing it on another
${branding}. Data can be pulled from a remote ${branding} and saved locally, or it can be pushed
from the user's ${branding} to a remote ${branding}. Metacards produced by replication are marked
with a "Replication Origins" attribute and a tag of "replicated".
Replication will automatically start transferring data once an admin creates a replication configuration.

The *replication* feature is not installed by default, so it will need to be installed before it can be used.
