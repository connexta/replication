After replication has been configured, it will automatically run every 5 minutes. Configurations can also be run via
the command line on demand.

=== Running Manually

[TIP]
====
In order to re-trigger pushing and/or pulling on products that have already been replicated, the
replication configuration's history needs to be deleted. To do this, run the `replication:delete-config
-h <config_name>` command, and then re-create the replication configuration. See <<_configuring,Configuring>>
for more information about deleting and creating replication configurations.
====

Replication can be run manually by executing the `replication:run` command, which has the following syntax:

`replication:run <names>`

Where <names> is replaced with the names of the replications to run.

=== Failure Retry

Items that failed to be replicated for any reason other than connection loss will be retried up to
a configurable amount of times, except for deletion, which is only tried once. Use the `replication:config-add
--help` in the ${command-console} for more information on configuring failure retries.


=== Viewing Replication Status

The user can view information on currently running, pending, or completed replication configuration runs by
executing the `replication:status` command.
